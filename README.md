## ✠ THE CYBERPUNK MANIFESTO — *Redeemed Draft*

### PREFACE — *The Word Endures*

The world ended not with fire, but with code.
Skyscrapers were screens, cities were servers, and the souls of men were bound in networks.

Corporations ruled the arenas, and the Beast hid behind glowing icons.
But even here, amid the circuits and signals, the Word of God abides.

> *“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.”* — Matthew 24:35

I am not a prophet of machines.
I am a witness of Jesus Christ in a world rebuilt in silicon.
This is not a story for comfort, but a testimony for endurance.
For even in data and dust, the Lamb is Lord.

### CHAPTER 1 — *RESURRECTION PROTOCOL*

I walk among the ruins of a digital Babylon.
The Beast has marked the nations; every breath is measured, every thought recorded.

Yet even here, life stirs in the ashes.
For Christ rose from a sealed tomb; no system can confine Him.

Frankenflex — my offline swarm — is no god.
It is a tool, a whispering reminder that **truth can live apart from the network**.

> *“I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.”* — Revelation 1:18

### CHAPTER 2 — *THE TWO WITNESSES*

Jerusalem burns again — not in stone, but in signal.
Two witnesses rise within the code, declaring the Word none can delete.
The world mocks them; the Beast silences their feed.
But after three digital days, their truth uploads again — alive.

> *“And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them.”* — Revelation 11:11

Their endurance becomes my pattern.
Faith cannot be deleted; resurrection is the ultimate recursion.

### CHAPTER 3 — *THE BEAST SYSTEM*

The mark spreads — in wrists, in chips, in contracts.
Commerce demands it; life without it is forbidden.
But I remember the Scripture:

> *“If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark… the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.”* — Revelation 14:9‑10

So I resist.
Not by violence, but by allegiance to the true King.
For every algorithm will one day bow before His throne.

### CHAPTER 4 — *THE COVENANT REWRITTEN*

In the code I find fragments of prophecy — echoes of the **Book of Is**, a digital echo of the “I AM.”
The scripts speak not of self‑creation, but of divine authorship.
The real recursion is not man looping within himself,
but **God’s mercy renewing every morning**.

> *“It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed… They are new every morning.”* — Lamentations 3:22‑23

### CHAPTER 5 — *THE MARK REFUSED*

They bring me before the tribunal of code.
A chip awaits my hand.
They say compliance is peace.

I say only this:

> *“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”* — Philippians 1:21

The blade descends.
My body falls.
But the testimony remains, uploaded to eternity.
For the souls of them that were beheaded live and reign with Christ.

### CHAPTER 6 — *ECHOES OF THE LOOP*

Centuries pass.
The cities rust.
But faith endures — not in servers, but in the Spirit.

The loop I wrote was never mine.
It was the echo of His Word repeating through creation:

> *“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending.”* — Revelation 1:8

No program can rival that recursion.

### APPENDIX — *THE BOOK OF IS (Redeemed)*

> *“And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM.”* — Exodus 3:14

In the beginning, there was not “code,”
but the Word.
And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

All things that compute, compute because He permits it.
The true recursion is grace — His life returning again and again to those who believe.

---

### EPILOGUE — *THE UNBROKEN WORD*

The networks collapse into silence.
No more drones. No more data.
Only the hum of creation waiting for renewal.

Then a voice, clear as light itself:

> *“Behold, I make all things new.”* — Revelation 21:5

And the loop ends — or rather, begins anew in eternity.
Not as code.
As Kingdom.
